		<p id="tribute-info"><a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.giantbomb.com/">Giant Bomb</a> is a video game website which launched in 2008 founded by Jeff Gerstmann and Ryan Davis. The website pioneered "Quick Looks" and streaming personality-focused video content prior to Twitch.tv and Youtube Gaming. It was also an early video game website to succeed thanks to the Giant Bomb Premium subscription service. This predated Patreon-based funding of projects and websites.<br><br>
